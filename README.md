Horiseion (Refactored Code Site)

The original html and css code has been edited with no changes to the original 
site look and feel.  The code has been updated with semantic html tags replacing the existing <div></div> tags to provide accessibility for users with disabilities.  Detailed comments have been added to the html and css code as well to provide clarity on the functionality of the code.
